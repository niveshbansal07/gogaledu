    seo_description: "Discover Riya's journey from confusion to clarity as she builds a career in data analysis using Excel, SQL & Power BI.",
    introduction: "Data Analysis is one of the fastest-growing careers today, but behind every analyst is a story that started with confusion, curiosity, and small steps. This blog follows Riya, a 22-year-old graduate who didn't know what career to pursue until GogalEdu Academy gave her direction.",
    story: [
      "Riya was like many fresh graduates — uncertain, overwhelmed, and frustrated. She had completed her BCA, but nothing excited her. Coding seemed too complicated, design didn't feel right, and traditional jobs felt monotonous.",
      "One evening, while scrolling through LinkedIn job posts, the term 'Data Analyst' kept appearing. She clicked one post out of curiosity. What surprised her was not the salary, but the job description — solving real business problems using data.",
      "She thought, 'Maybe I can try this.'",
      "She started their journey at GogalEdu Academy by learning Excel. At first, even VLOOKUP confused her. But slowly, formulas became familiar and patterns made sense. She then moved to SQL, where simple queries felt like solving puzzles. When she built her first Power BI dashboard, she felt something she hadn't felt in months — progress.",
      "During her internship, she analysed customer purchase patterns for an e-commerce brand. Her findings revealed why a popular product was underperforming. The company used her insights to fix the issue — and sales improved within a week.",
      "That day, Riya realised her work had real-world impact."

    introduction: "Most people believe business analysis is all about documents and meetings. But at its core, it's about understanding people — their problems, expectations, and goals. This is the story of Arjun, who accidentally discovered his love for this role.",
    story: [
      "Arjun completed his engineering degree but never felt confident in coding. His classmates were building apps, writing complex programs, and participating in hackathons, while Arjun struggled to stay interested.",
      "After graduation, he tried applying for software engineering roles, but something didn't feel right.",
      "During one project discussion, Arjun noticed the client was confused. The development team explained things using technical terms the client couldn't understand. Arjun stepped in and broke the process down in simple language. The entire room looked relieved.",
      "His manager said, 'Arjun, you explain things better than any of us. You should explore Business Analysis at GogalEdu Academy.'",
      "That was the turning point.",
      "Arjun reached out to GogalEdu's Counsellor and discovered that Business Analysts act as a bridge — they understand the business problem and help the tech team build the right solution. He learned requirement gathering, flowcharts, process mapping, writing user stories, stakeholder communication, and tools like Jira, Confluence, MS Visio, and basic SQL for data validation.",
      "In his first BA project as intern, he helped a retail company redesign their order management process. Their biggest issue was manual reporting, which wasted hours every day. After weeks of discussion and analysis, Arjun suggested an automated workflow.",
      "What earlier took 5 hours daily… now took just 10 minutes.",
      "The client personally emailed him: 'You changed the way our team works.'",
      "That message made Arjun realise the real value of a Business Analyst. The company gave him a full-time role."

    seo_description: "Read how Priya transformed her career from a call center job to MIS Analyst by mastering Excel & Power BI.",
    introduction: "MIS Analysts play one of the most underrated roles in any company. They are the silent backbone behind dashboards, performance tracking, and daily reports. This blog follows Priya — a young professional who discovered the power of Excel and transformed her career.",

      "Priya worked in a small BPO after graduation. Her role was simple: maintain attendance sheets and prepare basic sales reports. She didn't hate the job — but she didn't love it either.",

      "Curiosity took over. She watched a few videos about PivotTables and charts on GogalEdu's YouTube Channel. Soon, Excel became her favourite tool. She registered in MIS Training Program and started learning formulas (IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH), Pivot tables, charts, Power Query, and Power BI dashboards.",
      "Her first dashboard visualised daily sales for the department. When she showed it to her manager, he was shocked. The colourful visuals replaced seven different reports the team used earlier.",
      "That dashboard changed her career path.",
      "She was offered a role in the MIS department.",
      "There, she learned the real meaning of business reporting — cleaning data, analyzing performance trends, automating files with macros, and supporting leadership teams with insights.",

      "His first industrial project was transaction monitoring. One case stood out — multiple small accounts transferring money repeatedly to the same foreign account.",
      "Anshu analysed the behaviour and flagged it as suspicious.",
      "When the investigation was completed, the case was confirmed as part of a fraudulent network. His timely analysis prevented a major loss.",
